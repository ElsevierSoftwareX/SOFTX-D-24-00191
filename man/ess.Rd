  design,
  theta1 = NULL,
  n,
  n1,
  lambda,
  interim_fun,
  interim_params = list(),

}
\arguments{
\item{design}{An object of class \code{Basket} created by
\code{setupBasket}.}

\item{...}{Further arguments.}

\item{theta1}{Probabilities under the alternative hypothesis. If
\code{length(theta1) ==  1}, then this is a common probability for all
baskets. If \code{is.null(theta1)} then the type 1 error rate under the
global null hypothesis is computed.}

\item{n}{The sample size per basket.}

\item{n1}{The sample size per basket for the interim analysis in case of a
two-stage design.}

\item{lambda}{The posterior probability threshold. See details for more
information.}

\item{interim_fun}{Which type of interim analysis should be conducted
in case of a two-stage design.}

\item{interim_params}{A list of tuning parameters specific to
\code{interim_fun}.}

\item{weight_fun}{Which function should be used to calculate the pairwise
weights.}

\item{weight_params}{A list of tuning parameters specific to
\code{weight_fun}.}
